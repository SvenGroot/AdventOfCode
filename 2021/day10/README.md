# Day 10

[Puzzle description.](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10)

I like how VSCode almost solves this for you by coloring all the unmatched brackets red. Of course
it doesn't actually give you the answer the puzzle wants, and it doesn't look at `<>` brackets, but
it's still funny to me that even the editor is like, "hey, these lines are corrupted!"
