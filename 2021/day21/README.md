# Day 21

[Puzzle description.](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/21)

Part 1 was easy, and part 2 was yet another DFS with memoization.

At first I thought part 2 was way harder than it actually was, because after implementing it, my
implementation still didn't complete in anything resembling reasonable time. Turns out I missed that
the new maximum score was 21, not 1000. Oops.
