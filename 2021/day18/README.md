# Day 18

[Puzzle description.](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18)

I love getting to reuse something, and in this case it was the nested list, originally written for
[2022 day 13](../../2022/day13). In this case each list is exactly two items, but that didn't matter, and since the
string representation is the same, all the input parsing was already taken care of.
