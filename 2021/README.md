# Advent of Code 2021

Finished this one! Second AOC I've done.

## Favorite: [Day 22](day22) or [Day 23](day23)

It's a tie between these two. I liked day 22 because figuring out how to split the cubes was
interesting and not at all in my wheelhouse. Day 23 was pretty fun to model the problem.

## Least favorite: [Day 24](day24)

This would've been okay, but the fact that it required a lot of non-programmatic parsing of the
input to manually spot a pattern that could be used just didn't work for me. I wasted too much time
on dead-end attempts because I didn't realize that without a hint.

Typically, I want my solution to at least hypothetically work for anyone's input. Here, it will
only work if the input has the same structure as mine, which I gather it will based on what I've
read online, but I don't like having to make that assumption.
