# Day 2

[Puzzle description.](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)

This one was actually a bit simpler than day 1, I think. Day 1 part 2 got unusually involved for an
early day puzzle (not necessarily hard, just required a few more steps than I would've expected).

This one was very straightforward for both parts, with parsing the input honestly most of the work.
Of course I did that "properly," by creating structs and implementing `FromStr` as I like to do,
which adds to the amount of work required, but it's how I prefer to solve these.

But, definitely an easy one overall.
