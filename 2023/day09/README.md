# Day 9

[Puzzle description.](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9)

Funny story: when doing part 1, I immediately realized that I had to go through the diffs in reverse
to get the next value. Except, I forgot to actually do that in the code, and it works anyway because
it's just adding which is commutative.

So when I did part 2, I was suddenly very confused why it wasn't working, until I realized that I
was going through them in the wrong order, and this time it did matter. D'oh!
