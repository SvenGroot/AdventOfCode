# Day 6

[Puzzle description.](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6)

While the numbers in the input were low enough to brute force part 1, I immediately thought that
there's a math way to solve this. You can write the problem as a quadratic equation, which means it
can be solved using the quadratic formula.

And, I'm happy I did that, because with the altered way of parsing the input for part 2, brute
forcing likely would've been too slow.
