# Day 23

[Puzzle description.](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/23)

Part 2 seemed slow, but I was letting it run as I was thinking of alternatives. It seems that this
problem is NP-complete except for directed acyclic graphs, though I didn't check if the input is a
DAG or not.

While I was doing this, the slow version completed, so that's good enough.
