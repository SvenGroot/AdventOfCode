# Advent of Code

My answers to various [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles are available here. The
quality of these will vary; they weren't written to production standards.

Every year has its own `aoc` library so I can make changes without worrying about compatibility with
puzzles I did earlier.

Memo to self: to find the easter egg on each page, use `$("span[title]")` in the developer console.
