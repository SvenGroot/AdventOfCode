# Advent of Code 2022

I decided to do advent of code this year, and my answers are available here.

Doing it in Rust to get some more practice with that language. I write Rust a lot at work but
there's a lot of stuff in the standard library I never touch.

The quality of these will vary; they weren't written to production standards.
