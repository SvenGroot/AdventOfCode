# Day 25

[Puzzle description.](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/25)

A nice and easy one to finish on, and even consisting of only one part. I was wondering if the last
one would be hard or not, but I guess they figure people wouldn't want to spend too much time on
Christmas Day. Not that I finished this anywhere near Christmas Day. Closer to Christmas 2023 if
anything...

The later puzzles, while still fun, just take too much time for someone who isn't a professional
puzzle solver, so it became impossible to finish them on the day. That sapped me of the motivation
to continue at the time, until much later. At that point, it didn't matter how much time it took
me, since they were all already revealed anyway. Overall, I preferred the shorter ones, though.

Anyway, a fun series of puzzles, overall. I definitely want to do 2023 as well when it comes out.

## Favorite: [Day 24](../day24)

I just said I prefer the shorter puzzles, and this one definitely wasn't. However, I just loved that
I could figure out by myself why my approach didn't work, and come up with an alternative that did,
even though this kind of algorithmic stuff isn't something I often deal with in my day job.

## Least favorite: [Day 22](../day22)

It was just very tough to come up with a way to handle the folding, and I wasn't a fan of the fact
that doing it generically was both unnecessary (since everyone's input was the same shape; not that
you'd know without checking Reddit), and would've been much harder than just hardcoding the cube
transformations.

It should be said, however, that I did the later puzzles so long after the first batch that I don't
have a good recollection of how much I enjoyed the earlier ones or not, so these picks should be
taken with a grain of salt. I definitely remember [day 16](../day16) also being frustrating.
